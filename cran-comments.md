## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Removed the beginning text of the the Description in the DESCRIPTION file. Per the docs "It is good practice not to start with the package name, ‘This package’ or similar."

* Removed backticks from %>%.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.6.0
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.6.0
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
