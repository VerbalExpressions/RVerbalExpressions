\title{Match any character(s) except these any (including zero) number of times.}
\usage{
rx_anything_but(.data = NULL, value, mode = "greedy")
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{Expression to append, typically pulled from the pipe \code{ \%>\% }}

\item{value}{Characters to not match}

\item{mode}{Matching mode (\code{greedy} (default) or\code{lazy}). \code{Lazy} matching stops after the first match, \code{greedy} continues
searching until end of the string and then back-tracks to the last match.}
}
\description{
This expression will match everything except whatever characters
the user specifies in the \code{value} parameter. It does this by adding a
caret symbol \code{^} at the beginning of a character set \code{[]}. Typing
a caret after the opening square bracket negates the character class. The
result is that the character class matches any character that is not in the
character class. Unlike the dot, negated character classes also match
(invisible) line break characters. If you don't want a negated character
class to match line breaks, you need to include the line break characters in
the class.
